Description: Provides tools to detect and quantify local interaction events 
    between marine animals and vessels from tracking data. The package 
    implements simulation-based null models to identify attraction and 
    following behaviours derived from the methods described 
    in 'A simulation-based framework to detect marine animal–vessel interactions 
    using tracking data'. Functions support event detection, simulation workflows, 
    statistical testing, and reproducible application to new datasets.
